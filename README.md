# circ4life-oic2-validation-visualisation

This is a simple interactive visualization of a 4 dimensional rating.


## Concept

The basic Idea for this tool is to feature 4 sliders to
set a rating in 4 dimensions.
This 4 dimensional rating is then to be visualized as illustrated in the following
sketch by [Laurea](https://www.laurea.fi/en/).
